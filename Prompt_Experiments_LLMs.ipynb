You should use a generative text model (via an API or local) to do at least two tasks – e.g., summarize a news article and answer a question – and document how different prompts affect the output. This could be in a notebook form, showing the prompt, output, and a brief analysis of the results. The aim is to ensure you can interact with an LLM and understand the importance of how questions or instructions are phrased."
